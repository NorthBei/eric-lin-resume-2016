## Project Intro

### Introduction

這是我在 2016 年，就讀大三時製作的個人履歷網站<br/>
那時的我正就讀資工系，因為對應用開發有興趣，於是學了許多App Development的技能，包含前端/後端/Android App開發<br/>
大三的暑假為了找實習，開始準備、製作履歷，於是想要把自己會的技能、過往的專案透過網站視覺化呈現，作為履歷的一部分<br/>
所以自己設計並且開發了這版履歷網站

This is a personal resume website I created in 2016, during my junior year of university.<br/>
At the time, I was studying Computer Science and had developed a strong interest in application development, so I learned various skills related to app development, including front-end, back-end, and Android app development.<br/>
During the summer of my junior year, while preparing to apply for internships, I decided to create a resume that could visually showcase my skills and past projects through a website.<br/>
So I designed and developed this resume website entirely by myself.
